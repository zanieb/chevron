## Acknowledgements

This library is a fork of [chevron](https://github.com/noahmorrison/chevron) authored by [Noah Morrison](https://github.com/noahmorrison).

At this time, the only changes are switching to a modern build system, dropping support for Python 2, and verifying support for Python 3.7+.
